Lab 3, the Stack Smashing Lab involved testing stack buffer overflow in a UCLA SEASnet server, therefore other files and enviornments are
required to properly test the code. The process I took in the lab is written in "smashinglab.txt". Also, note that I was not able to fully 
implement the requirements for last step of the lab, due to a bug I was not able to solve at the time when I took the course.
